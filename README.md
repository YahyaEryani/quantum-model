# High-Energy Physics: Signal vs Background Classification
This is a project in the field of high-energy physics that aims to distinguish between signal and background processes using machine learning techniques. The goal is to differentiate between a signal process where new theoretical Higgs bosons (HIGGS) are produced, and a background process with the identical decay products but distinct kinematic features.

## Installation and Usage
To install and run the project, follow these steps:

1- Clone the project repository using git clone.
2- Install the required Python packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3- Run the preprocessing script to preprocess the data.
4- Run the training script to train the machine learning model.
5- Run the evaluation script to evaluate the model on a test dataset.
Note: The project requires Python 3.6 or higher.
